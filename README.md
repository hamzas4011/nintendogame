## 🌟 About the Project  
This frontend project was created during the course **Webutvikling 3** as part of my bachelor's degree in **Information Technology** with a specialization in **E-business** at Kristiania University College. In collaboration with my classmate, **Fazal**, we developed a website featuring a collection of Nintendo games, allowing users to interact with the games through various features.  

Although this repository focuses on the **frontend React.js** implementation, it is part of a larger **fullstack project** connected to a backend developed in **C#**, which provides full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing game data.  

### Key Features:  
- 🎮 **Game List:** Browse and explore Nintendo games with detailed information.  
- ⭐ **Game Rating:** Users can rate games to provide feedback.  
- ➕ **Add New Games:** Users can add new games to the list.  
- ❌ **Delete Games:** Remove games from the list.  

### Fullstack Overview:  
- The backend is developed with **C#** and offers CRUD operations through methods like `Create()`, `Read()`, `Update()`, and `Delete()`.  
- The backend project is maintained in a separate repository:  
  [NintendoGameApi](https://github.com/hamzas4011/NintendoGameApi).  

### Technology Stack:  
- **Frontend:** React.js  

This project demonstrates frontend development skills using modern frameworks and is part of a fullstack solution.

## 🌟 About the Project  
This fullstack project was created for the course **Webutvikling 3** in collaboration with my classmate, **Fazal**. The application is a website featuring a collection of Nintendo games, allowing users to interact with the games through various features.  

### Key Features:  
- 🎮 **Game List:** Browse and explore Nintendo games with detailed information.  
- ⭐ **Game Rating:** Users can rate games to provide feedback.  
- ➕ **Add New Games:** Users can add new games to the list.  
- ❌ **Delete Games:** Remove games from the list.  

### Fullstack Functionality:  
- The **frontend** was developed using **React.js** to create a dynamic and interactive interface.  
- The **backend**, built with **C#**, provides full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage game data.  
- The backend project is maintained in a separate repository:  
  [NintendoGameApi](https://github.com/hamzas4011/NintendoGameApi).  

### Technology Stack:  
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** C# with CRUD operations  

This project showcases a complete fullstack solution, combining frontend and backend development to deliver a user-friendly and functional application.
